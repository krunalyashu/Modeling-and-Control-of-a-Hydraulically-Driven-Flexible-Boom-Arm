Project Overview
This project focused on the system-level modeling, simulation, and control of a hydraulically driven crane with a flexible boom arm. The objective was to develop an integrated mechanical, hydraulic, and control model to analyze dynamic behavior, structural response, and controlled motion under varying load conditions.

System Description

The crane system consists of a flexible boom arm actuated by a double-acting hydraulic cylinder. The mechanical structure was modeled to capture mass distribution, stiffness, and deformation characteristics, while the hydraulic system included pumps, valves, and actuators responsible for generating motion. A control strategy was implemented to ensure smooth and stable lifting and lowering of the crane arm.
Mechanical and Structural Modeling

The boom arm was modeled as a flexible structure to realistically represent bending and vibration effects during operation. Finite element–based structural modeling techniques were used to evaluate deformation and dynamic response under applied loads. Additional payload mass was introduced at the boom tip to study the effect of load variation on system performance.

Hydraulic System Modeling

The hydraulic circuit was modeled to represent real industrial crane behavior, including pressure generation, flow control, and actuator dynamics. Key components such as a variable displacement pump, directional control valves, and a double-acting hydraulic cylinder were integrated into the simulation environment. Hydraulic losses and dynamic response were considered to improve realism.

Control System Design

A closed-loop control system was developed to regulate the motion of the crane arm. A PID-based controller was designed to achieve stable positioning, smooth lifting, and controlled return of the boom arm to its initial position. The controller performance was evaluated based on response time, overshoot, and stability under different load conditions.

Simulation and Integration

The complete system—mechanical structure, hydraulic circuit, and control logic—was integrated and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. System-level simulations were conducted to analyze motion trajectories, pressure variations, structural response, and control performance. The interaction between mechanical flexibility and hydraulic actuation was a key focus of the study.
