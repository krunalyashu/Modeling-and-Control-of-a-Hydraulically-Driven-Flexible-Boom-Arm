# Modeling-and-Control-of-a-Hydraulically-Driven-Flexible-Boom-Arm
Developed a system-level model combining mechanical structure, hydraulic actuation, and control logic using MATLAB/Simulink, demonstrating automation-oriented system integration and control design.
The crane’s mechanical components, including the pillar, piston-cylinder assembly, and lift arm, were modelled in SolidWorks.

 These components were then integrated with a hydraulic circuit featuring actuators such as a double-acting
 hydraulic cylinder, a variable displacement pressure-compensated pump, and a 4/3 directional control valve. This
 integration automated the system, eliminating the need for human intervention.
 Next, frequency analysis was conducted on the lift arm, the system’s only flexible component. Simulations were
 performed to evaluate its natural frequencies, ensuring stability and optimal performance.
 Finally, a PID control system was implemented, creating a closed-loop control system by enabling real-time feedback and precise control of the crane’s operations.
